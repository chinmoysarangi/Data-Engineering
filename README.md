# Data-Engineering

This page contains our code to a Data Engineering project where we have setup a Data Pipeline using Python and MongoDB.

The dataset used here is from NYC Taxi Trips dataset which can be found here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page

It contains Jupyter notebooks for Pick-up and drop-offs and Geomapping using Python Bokeh library.

Visualizations have been achieved via both Python Bokeh and Datashader libraries.

Also contains our Project Report and Presentation.
